-A broke ass highschool senior who's tryna get it without the four years
(not really broke but you get the point)



*At the time I'm writing this, It is February 24th, 2023, and the time is 4:07 (update 4:47) AM, I couldn't sleep so I went straight to go code and work on my Techdegree.
I think I've unintentially trained my body to [make me] feel unaccomplished when my days are unproductive. It causes me great mental stress at times, but I compensate by doing at least SOMETHING fulfilling.

**I've deactivated all my socials, and will reactivate once I've started learning JavaScript.

MY BRAIN FEELS LIKE A THOUSAND FUCKING ROCKS ARE BEING TOSSED AROUND AT A TIME AND IT DRIVES ME INSANEðŸ’¯ðŸ’¯ðŸ’¯ðŸ’¯

***And i have about $320 in the bank.
